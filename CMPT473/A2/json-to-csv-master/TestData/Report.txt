From the test case 10-17, there is 3 case passed and 5 case failed.
If I don't use pairwise testing, there will be totally 240 test case I have to test.

The hardest part of this assignment is partitioning. Dividing the block requir us knwoing very well about the input domain, in our program,
it requir us learn the json file well. How many data type it has, and what is the json object within object and json array within array.
After we finish the partitioning, erverything is easy.
